# Course support

Bio131 has a number of support systems to help you in this class. 

## Lab Time

Labs are informal and are deisgned to help you gain skills you need for the programming assignments that are completed out of class. You have an assigned lab section, but you are welcome to attend both labs if you would like more help with the lab or programming assignments. You are also free to switch lab sections, but please let me know if you want to make that a permanent switch.

## Student Hours: TBD

Student hours are times where I am in my office (Biology 200B) waiting for students to come talk with me. Drop in during these times to talk about anything (class related or otherwise), no appointment needed. Email me to set up an appointment if you cannot make student hour times.

## Tutoring (DoJo)

Tutoring is offered by Academic Support Services, and gives students additional times outside of class to get help with assignments and the course material. Each student can get up to one hour per week _per class_ of individual (one-on-one) tutoring.  You can sign up with others in class to book longer tutoring sessions (e.g., two hours for two students) pending the tutor's availablility. You can sign up for individual tutoring on the [Reed tutoring app](https://iris.reed.edu/tutor/tutors/profiles).

## Academic Accommodations

Please discuss any documented accommodations with me. Disability Accommodation Notification Letters can be obtained from [Disability & Accessibility Resources](https://www.reed.edu/disability-resources/).  All discussions will remain confidential.  

## Illness and Exceptional Circumstances

There may be cases where you cannot attend class for stretches at a time (due to illness, for example). In this case, email me to strategize a successful plan for learning the material. If you miss multiple classes and do not email me, I may reach out to make sure you are OK. 

In rare cases, there may be circumstances beyond your control where you are unable to meet the expectations outlined in this syllabus. If there are extenuating circumstances that might impact your academic performance in this class, please inform me as soon as you can to strategize a plan for completing all parts of the course. Additionally, you may want to reach out to the [Student Life Office](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/) at student-life@reed.edu, phone: (503) 517-7396, office: Eliot 218. The Student Life Office is dedicated to assisting students in accessing campus and support resources, especially during challenging situations.

## Obligated Reporting

I am happy to talk with you about anything that concerns you, but note that I (and many faculty) am an obligated reporter who must report possible violations of the [Title IX](https://www.reed.edu/governance/title-ix-policy/) and [DHSM](https://www.reed.edu/guidebook/comm_pol/dhsm_policy.html) policies which govern discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex, gender, and gender identity. Confidential resources are available at Health & Counseling Services and through the SHARE program; more information is available on [this page](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/concerned/confidentiality-obligatory-reporting.html).
