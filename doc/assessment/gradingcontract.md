### Grading Contract

The nine common assignments (exams E1-E2, programming assignments P1-P4, and book reflections B1-B3) are designed so that if students complete them (along with 6 of the 8 programming labs), they will earn a B. If you earn a B in the course, you will have learned _a lot_ about computational biology. You are expected to submit the work you have done by each deadline (you will be able to resubmit all work - see the [deadline policy](../policies.md#deadline-policy). **All work for the course must be completed by the last day of finals 5pm.**

Note that, according to the [schedule](../schedule.md), the common assignments will be completed by the beginning of Week 12. For the last two weeks, students can choose to revisit the common assignments they wish to improve upon or complete one or more of the [choose-your-own (CYO) assignments](cyo.md).

**There is no final exam for this class.**

## Grading Contract Table

The table below is based off of requirements for a B. To earn higher than a B, you will complete additional CYO assignments (along with completing more of the labs). If you partially complete assignments, miss assignments, or miss extra labs, that reduces your grade. 

Remember, you will have time near the end of the semester to revisit any of the work.

| Earned Grade | Assignment Requirements | #  Missed Assignments Allowed (9 total) | # Missed Labs Allowed (8 total) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| A | Requirements for a B and at least one CYO assignment in each theme (3 total) | 0 | 0 |
| A- | Requirements for a B and at least two CYO assignments | 0 | 0 |
| B+ | Requirements for a B and one CYO assignment | 0 | 1 |
| **B** | **Complete the Starter Assignment and the nine common assignments (E1-E2, P1-P4, B1-B3)** | **0** | **2** |
| B- | Requirements for a B, except 1 assignment is partially completed | 0 | 3 |
| C+ | Requirements for a B, except 2 assignments in different themes are partially completed | 0 | 3 |
| C | Requirements for a B, except 2 assignments in the same theme are partially completed | 0 | 3 |
| C- | Requirements for a B, except 3 assignments are missing or partially completed | 1 | 4 |
| D | Requirements for a B, except 4 assignments are missing or partially completed | 2 | 4 |
| F | Requirements for a D are not met | >2 | >4 |

**The number of missed assignments and labs are considered first.** For example:
- If you miss one assignment, you will earn no higher than a C- (even if all other work is complete/submitted and you have completed CYOs). 
- If you miss 3 of the 8 programming labs, you will earn no higher than a B- (even if all other work is complete).
- If you partially complete 3 assignments but have no missing assignments or missing labs, you will earn a C- (even though you are not missing work). 

## Assessment Communication
You will communicate your course plans at multiple points throughout the semester.

- Starter Assignment: in the first week, you will share your reasons for taking the course, what success in the course means to you, and your plans for achieving that success.
- At least once in the semester, you will meet with me one-on-one during the lab slot to reflect on your course goals and talk about any of the themes / assignments in the class.
- You are welcome to talk with me any time about your progress in the course and how it aligns with your goals. Communication is key.

## Illness and Exceptional Circumstances

_This also appears on the [support page](../support.md)_

There may be cases where you cannot attend class for stretches at a time (due to illness, for example). In this case, email me to strategize a successful plan for learning the material. If you miss multiple classes and do not email me, I may reach out to make sure you are OK. 

In rare cases, there may be circumstances beyond your control where you are unable to meet the expectations outlined in this syllabus. If there are extenuating circumstances that might impact your academic performance in this class, please inform me as soon as you can to strategize a plan for completing all parts of the course. Additionally, you may want to reach out to the [Student Life Office](https://www.reed.edu/student-life/) at student-life@reed.edu, phone: (503) 517-7396, office: Eliot 218. The Student Life Office is dedicated to assisting students in accessing campus and support resources, especially during challenging situations.
